# Social-Distancing-By-Occupation

# Regressions
The regressions.ipynb file can calculate regressions on a number of data fields including social distancing data, county income and county
employment. We regress county income and employment controls on social distancing and then implement the coefficient of income into our SEIRS
and income model.
